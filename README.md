# Logic-Building-Practice

This repository contains small, self-contained programs used to practice programming logic and structured program design. Each example focuses on implementing a single concept or calculation cleanly and correctly. Some programs demonstrate basic numerical or scientific ideas, while others apply mathematical or physical formulas to reinforce precision and clarity in computation. The goal of this repository is skill development and reasoning practice, rather than advanced numerical methods or large-scale scientific simulation.

## Programs included

1.) Inverse Square Law.f90:
This computation appears in gravitational force, electrostatics, and radiation
intensity models.

2.) MatrixMultiplication.f90:
Performs manual matrix multiplication using nested loops and compares it with
Fortran's built-in `matmul` intrinsic.

3.) TimeDilation.f90:
This program demonstrates time dilation in Special Relativity by computing Earth-observed time from a traveler’s proper time at near-light speeds.

4.) ForwardDifferenceApproximation.f90:
This program demonstrates Forward Difference Approximation. A numerical method used to estimate the derivative of a function by comparing the function’s values at a point and a slightly increased value of the input, dividing their difference by the step size.

5.) RadioActiveDecay.f90:
This program demonstrates Radioactive decay. A spontaneous transformation of an unstable atomic nucleus into a more stable one, releasing energy and particles in the process
