# Logic-Building-Practice

This repository contains small, focused Fortran programs that demonstrate
fundamental concepts in scientific and numerical computing.

## Programs included

1.) Inverse Square Law.f90:
This computation appears in gravitational force, electrostatics, and radiation
intensity models.

2.) MatrixMultiplication.f90:
Performs manual matrix multiplication using nested loops and compares it with
Fortran's built-in `matmul` intrinsic.
